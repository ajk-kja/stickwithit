        <h1>The Gigstrella: locking the edges of every song</h1>
        <p class="meta">Published February 24, 2026 · Practice workflow note</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Goodbye hackathon sprint, hello gig-ready focus</h2>
            <p>
                The original codename captured the hackathon weekend energy, but the tool has matured into a calmer coach that sits beside MetroGnome and Chopmeister. The rename to <strong>The Gigstrella</strong> tells players what it really does: help you nail the parts of a show that audiences actually remember—intros, codas, and any risky modulation in between. The UI still launches instantly on mobile, but the voice is now about control and confidence instead of speed-for-speed's-sake.
            </p>
            <p class="callout">
                The goal: make it obvious that this is where you go when a bandmate texts “can you cover our closer tonight?” and you only need to drill the edges.
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2>Setlist brain, not just a single-song toy</h2>
            <p>
                Upload as many tunes as you need for the next run of shows. Every song lands in the Setlist tab with its own waveform preview, duration, and file size so you can triage what still needs work. When you reopen the browser, Gigstrella remembers which tune was active, which markers were set, and whether AB or CD looping was toggled, so you can bounce between songs without rebuilding cues.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Per-song memory keeps intro/outro markers, loop states, and BPM context tied to the audio file.</li>
                <li>One tap loads the next song in the set, making it easy to rehearse transitions in show order.</li>
                <li>Setlist view doubles as a quick inventory: duration, file size, and loop badges surface what still needs attention.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>AB + CD loops keep intros and outros honest</h2>
            <p>
                The biggest upgrade is leaning all the way into the dual loop regions. AB is glued to the intro so you can rehearse the pickup, count-off, and first crash until the muscle memory sticks. CD hugs the outro or any other panic spot—bass drop, shout chorus, extended tag—and replays it the second you stop. Because each loop is stored with its parent song, you can build a whole night’s worth of problem areas and recall them instantly.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each loop remembers its own length, so the AB count-in can stay tight while the CD vamp stretches.</li>
                <li>Markers live with the audio inside your browser, meaning offline rehearsals still respect every punch-in you made last night.</li>
                <li>Loop buttons glow when active, making it obvious whether you are drilling the intro, outro, or the full tune before you hit the next venue.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Prep anywhere—rideshare, subway, green room</h2>
            <p>
                Upload the board mix, set BPM (manual or detected), drop markers, and start looping. Speed control (0.5x–1.5x) and click-track toggles make it a pocket rehearsal room. Because everything runs client-side, files stay local until you clear cache, so you can tweak loops in an Uber, tag a CD repeat on the subway, or finish notes side-stage without hunting for Wi-Fi or another app.

            <h2>Where The Gigstrella fits in the Stick With It stack</h2>
            <p>
                MetroGnome handles tempo awareness, Chopmeister chops licks into bite-size ideas, and The Gigstrella glues those ideas onto real songs. The shared palette + typography keep the experience coherent, and the blog (plus cron-fed change log) lets the community follow along as we keep sanding the workflow.
