        <h1>Three Free Drum Tools for Everyday Practice</h1>

            <p>
                Picture the typical wedding stage: cables everywhere, speeches running long, and an MD calling audibles between toasts. That’s the environment I had in mind when building these three browser tools. MetroGnome keeps the click one tap away, Lickmeister fills the downtime with fresh stickings, and The Gigstrella handles runtime math so the band can pivot without the drummer juggling spreadsheets.

            <h2>MetroGnome keeps the click honest</h2>
            <p>
                MetroGnome stays pinned on phones and tablets because the UI doesn’t care if it’s in portrait backstage or landscape on the riser. When an MD whispers “ballad first,” a drummer can double-tap the saved playlist chip and the right accent pattern is already armed. No downloads, no Bluetooth pairing, just a bright block pulsing in time while they count the band in.

            <h2>Lickmeister shakes loose new ideas</h2>
            <p>
                Slow moments between sets are where bad habits creep in. Lickmeister’s four-line grid gives players something better to do than doomscroll. Tap in a kick-snare phrase, hear it loop immediately, and either keep it or clear it. Because the UI mirrors the metronome palette, it still feels like the same practice room even though the brain is working on a different skill.

        <section>
            <h2>The Gigstrella nails the edges</h2>
            <p>
                The third slot used to be “Setlist Sprint,” but the new name fits better. The Gigstrella is where a drummer drops the board mix, marks the AB intro and CD outro, and loops the tricky bits. Before showtime they can loop the double-time ride tag until it feels automatic; during the gig the same project spits out the adjusted runtime the second a tune gets cut. Less panic, more playing.
